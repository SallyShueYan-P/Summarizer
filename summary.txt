b'Teams are pitted against one another in weekly head-to-head matchups, where the team with the greater number of fantasy points for the week is awarded a win'
b"Season Points Those who prefer points to roto but aren't a fan of the head-to-head format might love Season Points"
b'As with fantasy football, though, a Head-to-Head Points league can adopt any sort of schedule type: Three single-week playoff matchups following a 22-week regular season (or 21 if you choose to eliminate the final week due to major league teams often resting up for their own playoffs), multiweek matchups all season (regular season and playoffs), "all play" where every team is matched up against every possible opponent every week (unavailable in ESPN games), or even regular season-only, where the champion of the league is the one that has the best record when the major-league season concludes'
